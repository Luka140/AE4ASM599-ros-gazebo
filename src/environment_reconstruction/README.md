# Environment Reconstruction
This package contains various nodes to reconstruct a point cloud from a stereo image setup and manipulate it. 
It is not a streamlined product but rather the result of experimentation for the sake of learning. The **image2map** package
shows a more direct pipeline, based on some of the nodes in this package. 

## Usage


In one window, start up the reconstruction node using
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch environment_reconstruction launch_3d_reconstruction.launch.py
```

Open the simulation in another window using
```
export IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=$IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH:$HOME/ros2_ws/gazebo_files/
ign gazebo worlds/tugbot_depot.sdf
```

In a new window open RViz2:
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
rviz2 
```
In this window go to 'file' -> 'open config' and open '3d_reconstruction_test.rviz'


The vehicle can be driven around using the arrow keys. Pressing "S" stops the vehicle. For this to work, the 'key publisher' in Gazebo needs to be enabled.

### Pointcloud Aggregation

File: `pointcloud_aggregation.py`

This node aggregates multiple point clouds into a single point cloud. It listens to a topic for incoming point clouds, transforms them into the global frame, and publishes the aggregated point cloud.

#### Parameters:
- global_frame_id: The global frame to transform point clouds into.
- pointcloud_topic: Topic name for incoming point clouds.
- pointcloud_publish_topic: Topic name for the aggregated pointcloud.

#### Subscriptions
- Reconstruction Subscription
  
        Topic: Specified by the pointcloud_topic parameter (default is "reconstruction").
        Message Type: sensor_msgs.msg.PointCloud2
        Callback: reconstruction_callback

#### Publishers
- Aggregated Point Cloud Publisher
  
        Topic: Specified by the pointcloud_publish_topic parameter (default is "total_pointcloud").
        Message Type: sensor_msgs.msg.PointCloud2


#### How it works
The node listens to the points published by the Stereo Reconstruction node. It then finds the TF2 transform from the world frame to the relative frame the point cloud is in. The points are then set to the world frame using this transform and added to the collection of previously transformed points. All these points are collected into a large point cloud which is then published. 

----
   
### Positioning
File: `positioning.py`

The locator node listens to bridged pose messages from Gazebo and then broadcasts them as TF2 transforms. This is simply a 'hack' to get the ground truth position from Gazebo.

#### Parameters

The node uses the following parameter:

- vehicle_path: The ROS parameter that specifies the path to the vehicle model. Default is /model/Test_car.

#### Subscriptions

- Ground Truth Position Subscription
  
        Topic: Specified by the vehicle_name parameter, formatted as /model/{vehicle_name}/pose.
        Message Type: tf2_msgs.msg.TFMessage
        Callback: broadcast_transform

#### Publishers

- Transform Broadcaster
  
        Type: tf2_ros.TransformBroadcaster

- Static Transform Broadcaster
  
        Type: tf2_ros.StaticTransformBroadcaster

### Stereo Reconstruction

File: `stereo_reconstruction.py`

The Reconstructor node is designed to create 3D reconstructions from stereo camera images. It subscribes to image and camera info topics, processes the images to generate a disparity map, and computes the corresponding 3D point cloud. This point cloud is then published for further use by other nodes. 

#### Parameters

The node allows configuration through several parameters:

- distance_limit: Maximum distance to consider for points in the point cloud (default: 30.0).
- left_camera_topic: Topic for the left camera images (default: /camera_l).
- right_camera_topic: Topic for the right camera images (default: /camera_r).
- camera_info_topic: Topic for the camera info (default: /camera_info).
- published_topic: Topic to publish the reconstructed point cloud (default: reconstruction).
- recon_service_tag: Service tag for the reconstruction service (default: reconstruct_3d_view).

#### Subscriptions

- Left Camera Image Subscription
  
        Topic: Defined by the left_camera_topic parameter, e.g., /camera_l
        Message Type: sensor_msgs.msg.Image
        Callback: update_img_l

- Right Camera Image Subscription
  
        Topic: Defined by the right_camera_topic parameter, e.g., /camera_r
        Message Type: sensor_msgs.msg.Image
        Callback: update_img_r

- Camera Info Subscription
  
        Topic: Defined by the camera_info_topic parameter, e.g., /camera_info
        Message Type: sensor_msgs.msg.CameraInfo
        Callback: update_camera_info

#### Services

- Reconstruct Service
  
        Type: interfaces.srv.Reconstruct
        Callback: reconstruct_view

#### Publishers

- Reconstructed Point Cloud Publisher
  
        Topic: Defined by the published_topic parameter, e.g., reconstruction
        Message Type: sensor_msgs.msg.PointCloud2
        Function: Publishes the reconstructed point cloud using create_pointcloud_msg


#### How It Works

- Image Reception: The node listens to the left and right camera image topics and updates the stored images.
- Camera Info Reception: The node listens to the camera info topic and updates the camera calibration data.
- Disparity Map Computation: Using OpenCV, the node computes a disparity map from the stereo images.
- 3D Point Cloud Computation: The node calculates the real-world coordinates from the disparity map and camera calibration data.
- Point Cloud Publishing: The reconstructed 3D point cloud is published to the specified topic.
- Reconstruction Service: The service can be called to perform the reconstruction process and obtain the 3D point cloud.

## Other files
### `utils.py`
This Python module provides utility functions for working with ROS2 PointCloud2 messages, specifically for creating unstructured point clouds from NumPy arrays and converting PointCloud2 messages back to NumPy arrays.

Features
- create_unstructured_pointcloud: Converts a NumPy array of points to a ROS2 PointCloud2 message.
- pcl2array: Converts a ROS2 PointCloud2 message to a numpy array.


#### Function Descriptions
`create_unstructured_pointcloud(points: np.ndarray, frame_id='world', time=None) -> PointCloud2`

Creates an unstructured point cloud from a NumPy array of points.

Parameters:
- points: A NumPy array of shape [N, 3] or [N, 4] containing the points. If the array has shape [N, 3], it should contain [x, y, z] coordinates. If it has shape [N, D] where D>3, the first three dimensions should still be [x, y, z].
- frame_id: The frame id of the point cloud. Defaults to 'world'.
- time: ROS2 time at which the point cloud is created. If None, the current time is used.

Returns:
- PointCloud2: The created PointCloud2 message.

`pcl2array(pcl_msg: PointCloud2, flatten=False) -> np.ndarray`

Converts a PointCloud2 message to a numpy array.

Parameters:
- pcl_msg: The PointCloud2 message to be converted.
- flatten: If True, returns an array in the unstructured format, regardless of the point cloud message.

Returns:
- np.ndarray: The converted NumPy array.


# Overview 
Note that this nodal architecture is not optimal. It is more complex than necessary and not always consistent. This is a result of the fact that this package is simply the result of experimentation without a specific goal.
